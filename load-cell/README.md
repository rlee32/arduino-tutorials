# Force Measurement Using a (Cantilever) Load Cell

This repository can be found at:  
https://github.com/rlee32/arduino-tutorials/tree/master/load-cell  

This example uses a cantliever load cell for force measurement. 
It works by measuring the stretch of strain gauges attached to the surface of 
a bending beam. Assuming a linear relationship between the stretch and force 
applied allows us to estimate the magnitude of the force applied.  

The signal provided by the load cell must be amplified in order to be read 
accurately by the Arduino.
