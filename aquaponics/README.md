# Under Construction


The system will comprise of:

-Fish tank.
-Grow bed.
-Outlet water pump.
-Inlet water pump.
-Vibrating automated fish feeder.
-Arduino microcontroller.

The grow bed will be filled with a growing medium, such as pea gravel, and have a passive outlet that regulates the maximum water level.

The inlet water will continuously be pumping into the grow bed. The outlet pump will trigger after a certain amount of time programmed into the Arduino and pump out the water to empty the grow bed and aerate the roots.

The outlet pump should not pump too long, as usually water pumps have issue with being turned on without the presence of water. There are two ways of regulating the outlet pump:
-Set a fixed length of time for the outlet pump.
-Use a water level sensor to stop the outlet pump when the grow bed is empty.
In both cases, a reservoir of water underneath the growth medium should be established to ensure that there will always be water in the outlet pump when the growth medium is drained.
